            <h3>
              Vancouver, a city where outdoor enthusiasts and city folks can
              thrive!
            </h3>
            <p>
              Surrounded by mountains and ocean, Vancouver is a paradise for
              people who love the outdoors—but it also has culture down to a
              tee. Vancouver may be best known for its rugged natural beauty,
              but it's also got a vibrant cultural side. Residents get best of
              both world's!
              <br />
              <br />Vancouver is a park lover's paradise, and that's not
              hyperbole: there are over 230 municipal local parks comprising 11%
              of the city's footprint. Some are well known and Stanley Park, the
              jewel in Vancouver's crown, has an international reputation:
              larger than New York City's Central Park, interlaced with gentle
              foot paths, and featuring natural lagoons, sandy beaches, and the
              world class Vancouver Aquarium, it's hardly surprising that it's
              usually the first box ticked on every “Must See” list

            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>
              My name is Marie-Josée Dubé, Ive been living in Vancouver for
              seven years now. I moved here for my love of the mountains. I love
              hiking, rock climbing, trail running, kayaking but also going into
              the city for live music or a good restaurant. Vancouver can offer
              all of the above activities and I beleive that's what makes this
              city very special!
