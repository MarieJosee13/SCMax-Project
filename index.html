            <h2>Why Vancouver?</h2>

            <h3>
              Vancouver, a city where outdoor enthusiasts and city folks can
              thrive!
            </h3>
            <p>
              Surrounded by mountains and ocean, Vancouver is a paradise for
              people who love the outdoors—but it also has culture down to a
              tee. Vancouver may be best known for its rugged natural beauty,
              but it's also got a vibrant cultural side. Residents get best of
              both world's!
              <br />
              <br />Vancouver is a park lover's paradise, and that's not
              hyperbole: there are over 230 municipal local parks comprising 11%
              of the city's footprint. Some are well known and Stanley Park, the
              jewel in Vancouver's crown, has an international reputation:
              larger than New York City's Central Park, interlaced with gentle
              foot paths, and featuring natural lagoons, sandy beaches, and the
              world class Vancouver Aquarium, it's hardly surprising that it's
              usually the first box ticked on every “Must See” list

              <h4>BC Coastal Indigenous culture</h4>
              <p>
                The hən̓q̓əmin̓əm̓ and skqxwu7mesh speaking peoples, the Musqueam,
                Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh Nations, have occupied these lands
                since time immemorial.
                <br />
                <br />
                Today, there are approximately 200,000 Indigenous people in B.C.
                They include First Nations, Inuit and Métis. There are more than
                200 distinct First Nations in B.C., each with their own unique
                traditions and history.
              </p>

              <p></p>
              <h5>What I like about it</h5>
              <p>
                This city is a melting pot of every culture, I think it's
                important to understand how the indigenous peoples lived here
                before Vancouver became what it is today. We can find out how
                they made use of the practices then and still continue to try
                and keep alive in modern society.

              <h4>Sking on North Shore mountains</h4>
              <p>
                A mountain that you can access by public transit?
                <br />
                <br />Grouse Mountain is the only truly four-season destination
                in the lower mainland and features a wildlife refuge, dining
                options, thrilling outdoor adventure, summer activities galore
                and the best in local snow sports.
              </p>

              <p></p>
              <h5>What I like about it</h5>
              <p>
                I like this mountain more in the summer as an avid hiker, but
                this mountain is loved by a lot of snow lovers. In the summer,
                it gives hiking access to the backcountry mountains.
              </p>

              <h4>European Influence in Gastown</h4>
              <p>
                Gastown is where you'll find the old town of Vancouver with its
                heritage brick buildings, historic character, tourist shops and
                fine restaurants.
                <br />
                <br />
                Gastown was Vancouver's first neighbourhood and was named for
                "Gassy" Jack Deighton, a Yorkshire seaman, steamboat captain and
                barkeep who arrived in 1867 to open the area's first saloon.
              </p>

              <p></p>
              <h5>What I like about it</h5>
              <p>
                I like coming here for a walk in the city, urban coffee shops
                and a variety of restaurents. It is important to understand the
                history of gastown and the relations to our Indigenous peoples.
              </p>

            <p>
              My name is Marie-Josée Dubé, Ive been living in Vancouver for
              seven years now. I moved here for my love of the mountains. I love
              hiking, rock climbing, trail running, kayaking but also going into
              the city for live music or a good restaurant. Vancouver can offer
              all of the above activities and I beleive that's what makes this
              city very special!
